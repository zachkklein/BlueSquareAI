The "elite control" trope refers to narratives suggesting that Jews collectively control powerful institutions such as media, finance, governments, or global decision-making.

This trope often appears implicitly, without explicitly naming Jews, using phrases such as "they control the media" or "global elites manipulate outcomes."

Historically, this trope has been used to portray Jews as secretive, manipulative, and disproportionately powerful, and is a well-documented form of antisemitic rhetoric.

Context is critical: claims about powerful individuals or institutions are not inherently antisemitic unless they invoke collective, identity-based accusations.
