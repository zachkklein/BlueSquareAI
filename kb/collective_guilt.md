Collective guilt refers to holding Jews as a group responsible for actions taken by individual Jews, Jewish organizations, or the state of Israel.

This trope treats Jewish identity as inherently political or conspiratorial and erases individual agency.

Statements that assign blame or responsibility to Jews as a collective are widely recognized as antisemitic.
