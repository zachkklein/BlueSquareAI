# Israel Criticism vs Antisemitism

Criticism of Israel as a state is not inherently antisemitic.

Indicators of antisemitism include:
- Holding all Jews responsible for Israel’s actions
- Denying Jewish self-determination uniquely
- Using classic antisemitic tropes to discuss Israel

Context and framing are critical.
