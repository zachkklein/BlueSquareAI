# Blood Libel Trope

A historical antisemitic myth alleging that Jews harm or kill non-Jews for ritualistic purposes.

Modern variants may:
- Avoid explicit ritual language
- Imply secret cruelty or lack of regard for life
- Use vague accusations of hidden practices

Important distinction:
Criticism of religious practices must be evidence-based and specific, not rooted in myth or insinuation.
