The "dual loyalty" trope refers to accusations that Jews are more loyal to Israel or Jewish interests than to their country of citizenship.

This trope suggests that Jewish individuals or communities cannot be trusted as full members of a national or political community.

Such claims are considered antisemitic when they generalize or presume collective disloyalty based on Jewish identity, rather than addressing specific actions of individuals or governments.
