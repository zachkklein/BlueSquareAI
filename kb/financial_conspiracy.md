# Financial Conspiracy Narratives

This trope portrays Jews as manipulating financial systems for malicious gain.

Common features:
- Focus on banking or debt as moral corruption
- Family-based conspiracies (e.g. dynasties)
- Claims of global coordination

Important distinction:
Criticism of financial systems or capitalism is not antisemitic unless it invokes ethnic conspiracy.
