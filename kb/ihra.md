The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) defines antisemitism as:

"A certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."

The IHRA definition notes that antisemitism can be implicit or coded and may include stereotypes, conspiracy theories, or collective accusations against Jews as a group.

Importantly, the IHRA definition emphasizes context, intent, and effect, and distinguishes between legitimate political critique and rhetoric that relies on antisemitic tropes or collective blame.
