# Holocaust Denial and Distortion

This trope denies, minimizes, or reframes the Holocaust to undermine Jewish historical suffering.

Common features:
- Claims the Holocaust was exaggerated or fabricated
- Framing Jews as exploiting tragedy
- Selective skepticism applied only to Jewish suffering

Important distinction:
Academic debate about historical interpretation is not denial unless it dismisses established evidence.
