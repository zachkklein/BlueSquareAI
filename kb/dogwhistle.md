Dogwhistle language refers to coded or indirect language that conveys a message understood by a specific audience without being explicit.

In antisemitic contexts, dogwhistles may include references to "globalists," "elites," "bankers," or unnamed groups controlling institutions.

Such language is not inherently antisemitic and must be interpreted in context, including surrounding claims, targets, and historical usage.
