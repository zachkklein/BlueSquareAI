# Ambiguity and Uncertainty Guidelines

Many statements exist in a gray area between legitimate critique and antisemitic rhetoric.

Guidelines:
- Avoid binary judgments
- Consider alternative interpretations
- Examine whether identity is essential to the claim’s meaning

Systems should err on the side of caution and explanation rather than accusation.
